# Investigating evolutionary drift in the Philippines

Quantifying and modeling Spanish colonial influence on Philippine languages through
computational-linguistic analysis. The project measures the structural similarity of
Philippine languages to a set of baseline languages (Spanish, plus English/Japanese and
unrelated controls) along two independent dimensions, then models and visualizes the
resulting structure geographically.

- **Phonemes** — phoneme inventories from PHOIBLE.
- **Grammar** — typological features from GRAMBANK (Spanish features cross-referenced from WALS).
- **Cognates** — lexical/Swadesh-list similarity via LingPy *(exploratory; excluded from the paper for now)*.

For each dimension the workflow is: build a binary feature dataframe → compute a weighted
cosine-similarity / distance matrix → fit distance-decay regressions and Mantel tests →
feed distances into **EEMS** (Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces, run in MATLAB) →
overlay a minimum spanning tree (MST) and historical "waypoint" migration routes on a map.

This is a collection of analysis scripts run interactively, not a software package — there
is no build system or test suite.

## Repository layout

```
R/
  phoneme_analysis/   Numbered PHOIBLE pipeline ([0]→[1]→[2]→[3]) + EEMS prep + shuffled null
  grammar_analysis/   Numbered GRAMBANK pipeline ([0]→[1]→[2]→[4]) + EEMS prep + shuffled null
  cognate_analysis/   LingPy cognate analysis (gitignored; not used for the paper)
  helpers/            default.eems.plots.R (vendored EEMS plotting helper)
data/                 All R-pipeline data: inputs + intermediates (read/written via here("data", ...))
figures/              Generated plots, grouped by section/type (gitignored)
python/               Waypoint/optimal-path notebooks + LingPy helper (run as-is; not maintained here)
matlab/               EEMS (MATLAB): one folder per analysis; MCMC run outputs are gitignored
swadeshlist_jsons/    Per-language Swadesh wordlists (cognate input)
```

## Paths convention

All R scripts resolve files with [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) anchored to the RStudio
project (`Indp Research Phillipine Languages.Rproj`), e.g. `read_csv(here("data", "PHOIBLEdf_PH.csv"))`.
Open the `.Rproj` (or set the working directory to the project root) before sourcing any script.

## Pipeline order

Scripts pass data through files in `data/`, so order matters. Within each analysis folder the
bracketed prefix is the execution order:

1. **`[0]_*database.R`** — fetch from PHOIBLE/GRAMBANK (via `lingtypology`), filter to the study
   languages, pivot to a binary feature matrix, write the feature matrix + IDF frequency table.
2. **`[1]_*analysisweighted_span.R`** — weighted cosine similarity (log-IDF weighting), the
   graph-based waypoint network, geodesic/land-penalized distances, distance-decay regression,
   and Mantel tests; writes the cosine/cossim matrices and the waypoint-plot object.
3. **`*_EEMS.R`** — turn the similarity scores into the EEMS dissimilarity (`datapath.diffs`) and
   coordinate (`datapath.coord`) inputs, plus a shuffled null-model variant.
4. *(MATLAB)* run the EEMS MCMC in `matlab/matlab_eems_*/eems*.m`, consuming the `datapath.*` files.
5. **`[2]_eems_plot_*_span.R`** — render the EEMS MCMC output (`reemsplots2`) into a base map RDS.
6. **`[3]/[4]_*_weight_mst_eems_span.R`** — overlay MST edges / waypoint routes on the base map.

`*_shuffled` / `eems_plot_*_shuffled.R` are permutation null-model runs used to assess
significance against the real analysis.

## Python ↔ R coupling (important)

The waypoint network is produced in Python and consumed in R. The two notebooks in `python/`
are kept **as-is** (their internal file paths are still Windows paths and must be updated before
re-running):

- `python/waypointsystem.ipynb` writes `nodes.csv`, `edges.csv`.
- `python/optimal_path.ipynb` reads `GRAMFEATURE_match_df.csv`, `PHOIBLE_z_score_df.csv`; writes
  `mst_edges_{GA,PA}.csv`, `smooth_path_{GA,PA}.csv`.

These files live in `data/`. If you re-run the notebooks, point them at `data/` (or move their
outputs there) so the R scripts pick them up.

## Prerequisites

- **R 4.3+** with: `tidyverse`/`dplyr`/`readr`, `here`, `lingtypology`, `geosphere`, `rethinking`,
  `infotheo`, `proxy`, `reshape2`, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `igraph`, `sf`/`sfheaders`,
  `rnaturalearth`(`data`), `maps`, `reemsplots2`.
- **MATLAB/Octave** for the EEMS MCMC step (third-party EEMS code vendored under `matlab/**/mscripts/`).

## Not tracked in git

Figures, the cognate analysis, credentials, archived legacy scripts, large source databases
(`values.csv`, `languages.csv`, `logicalTLI_*`), generated `.rds` objects, and EEMS MCMC run
outputs are gitignored (see `.gitignore`). Regenerate them by running the pipeline.
